  <p>The above image shows my home page interface . This is the start page of the website Different tags properties and attributes are used while designing this page.The website looks more attractive by adding a suitable background image so I used a background image on the home page which was clicked by me. On the top right side of my home page, there is the navigation bar. There are different pages in the navbar such as home, contact, CV, Site report.As we can see background colour is used in the navbar. There is also a hamburger icon which is also called the menu icon, the hotdog menu, three-line menu or menu button. This hamburger menu used to make it easier to view page and menu options on mobile devices. When you view your page on the mobile navbar will hide and it will show the hamburger menu (three bars) in the top left corner of the page, click on it to toggle the menu.The page is responsive in all devices. I have put a hover effect, border-radius, and box-shadow behind the navigation bar.There is a short description below the navigation on the left side of the middle body part. I have  put the portfolio button on a short description that is link with the portfolio page.There is a hover effect and border-box in the portfolio button as well. For this page, I have used sanserif font style but in a short description of mine, I have used italic font style which I have taken from w3schools. Different colour is used in this page like red, black, and crimson, purple.</p>

<p> The above image represents my portfolio page. Portfolio refers to a collection of drawings, documents and other projects that represents a person's work. There are six same height, width, padding, and margin etc. given placeholder image with the same background image.  When we point the cursor in images, the image slightly moves down which is because of the use of transform and translate animation in hover. This page is also responsive on all devices. When we reduce the screen width in responsive view dummy images are move down with respective width. So here on this page, all the dummy images can be replaceable with my future made project, work from term 2 and other modules which is worthy of my portfolio. There is also a dummy text box below the image where we can write our project title and its description.</p>

  <h3>MODULE AND BASIC WEB DEVELOPMENT EXPERIENCE:</h3> <br>
  <p>At the end of the past year, I decided to change careers to become a Software developer since then I was struggling to find the best way to learn code like HTML & CSS effectively so in march I have started my new journey in NAMI college before joining I haven't done HTML and CSS. I have the only idea that these languages are used in making websites.  I had the only idea that these languages are used in making websites. When I was doing my first HTML it was quite difficult to remember the tags and to give a proper div, classes. Then I  learned the properties and use of all the tag used in HTML. My first experience in CSS was also the same as HTML. I got some problem while giving background image in the proper size margin and padding while giving a position and other designing tags. When I was making this website also I got many problems like while making hamburger icon, toggling the navbar, while applying grid properties in portfolio page image, while using grid properties in website site report image and while using grid between two boxes and logos on cv. So in the first week teacher taught us how to create add and push any file in Github. In the second weeks, I learn to make a website with a header main container and footer with appropriate CSS properties teacher give us the advice to use one tool I have used sublime text3. I have faced many problems while creating that website like giving div class, a proper tag of header main footer and while linking in CSS and then to give proper margin, padding, background colour. And the next week was to create a webpage using float properties. It was quite difficult then than I have expected .many bugs are created at that time, but I analyze the code and debugged the problem. Further, weeks I have done an ottergram project i.e. arranging picture in column with the given name, and learn display flex properties, inline-block elements, block elements, position, making website responsive and Google material design like borders, animation transition, colour gradient and shadow in text. I have learned to make form and table and grid properties which are usually used in responsive.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h3>UPS AND DOWNS:</h3><br>
  <p>There are various ups and downs while learning basic web development since I haven’t done this before so I have faced many problems while making a website. It's much easier to write code, looking through old code, understanding it and making it better is much more of a challenge.  I have faced most of the problem while designing a website layout, colour, fonts and images, nowhere to get padding, nowhere to get fixed margin and matching colour.so, building a website is a daunting process full of potential pitfalls. When I was making the Github repository, I had a lot of problem in cloning the repository to create a local copy on my computer and sync between the two locations. I had learned to make a header,  main, container and footer. I have got many problems while making that on a webpage. I got a problem while giving its perfect margin, padding, width, height. While creating float property proper. I got a problem with the width.</p>
