  <h1>HOME PAGE</h1>
  <img class="image2" src="Screenshot 2021-05-28 204800.png" alt="">
  <p>The above image shows my home page interface . This is the start page of the website Different tags properties and attributes are used while designing this page.The website looks more attractive by adding a suitable background image so I used a background image on the home page which was clicked by me. On the top right side of my home page, there is the navigation bar. There are different pages in the navbar such as home, contact, CV, Site report.As we can see background colour is used in the navbar. There is also a hamburger icon which is also called the menu icon, the hotdog menu, three-line menu or menu button. This hamburger menu used to make it easier to view page and menu options on mobile devices. When you view your page on the mobile navbar will hide and it will show the hamburger menu (three bars) in the top left corner of the page, click on it to toggle the menu.The page is responsive in all devices. I have put a hover effect, border-radius, and box-shadow behind the navigation bar.There is a short description below the navigation on the left side of the middle body part. I have  put the portfolio button on a short description that is link with the portfolio page.There is a hover effect and border-box in the portfolio button as well. For this page, I have used sanserif font style but in a short description of mine, I have used italic font style which I have taken from w3schools. Different colour is used in this page like red, black, and crimson, purple.</p>

<h1>PORTFOLIO PAGE</h1>
<img  class="image2" src="Screenshot 2021-05-28 211741.png" alt="">
<p> The above image represents my portfolio page. Portfolio refers to a collection of drawings, documents and other projects that represents a person's work. There are six same height, width, padding, and margin etc. given placeholder image with the same background image.  When we point the cursor in images, the image slightly moves down which is because of the use of transform and translate animation in hover. This page is also responsive on all devices. When we reduce the screen width in responsive view dummy images are move down with respective width. So here on this page, all the dummy images can be replaceable with my future made project, work from term 2 and other modules which is worthy of my portfolio.There is also a dummy text box below the image where we can write our project title and its description.</p>
